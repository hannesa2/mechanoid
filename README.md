Mechanoid with Gradle  support
=============

Mechanoid is an Eclipse Plugin sporting a set of code generators for Androidâ„¢ driven by Simple DSL's (Domain Specific Languages) with full Eclipse Editor Support for the rapid development of Android applications.

But since Android uses as IDE Intellij (Android Studio) the code generation doesn't work any more. But some old project still uses this generated 
code and have to fix some issues. Unfortunatelly the original maintainer seams to be not interesed any more. 

This is the motivation for this fork  


Mechanoid DB
------------
Here Room from Google is a modern replacement and there is [secure Room](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-saferoom) as well 

Mechanoid Net
-------------
Retrofit with Rx is a good replacement

Mechanoid Ops
-------------
This is the part why I maintain this repo because I've no good replacement found. Any suggestion is welcome

Mechanoid Prefs
---------------
Here I use secure [DBPReferences](https://github.com/hannesa2/DbPreferences) as replacement
